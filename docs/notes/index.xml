Once the file is downloaded, follow the installation prompts.&#xA;Check Download After the download is complete, we can check that we have the additional version of Python installed. We should see both versions listed, and a star next to the active version.</description>

      <description>Version Troubles I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with Neo Vim a lot more than I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing about it. It&amp;rsquo;s been 19 days since I first got trapped and despite that short time, I feel quite comfortable using the tool. There is certainly a ton of learning still to go before I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to zoom around and manipulate code at the speed of thought, but progress is progress.&#xA;The version that the Windows Subsystem for Linux installs is v0.</description>

      <description>Neo Vim Lesson Series Looking up all the Vim content on YouTube told the algorithm to send me some more. I stumbled upon a series by the creator ThePrimeagen that details more commands in Vim and Neo Vim. I&amp;rsquo;ll do my best to only add here what hasn&amp;rsquo;t been covered already. But if you&amp;rsquo;re interested, here&amp;rsquo;s the link to the full playlist.&#xA;Introduction (#1) This covers a lot of the basics that the Vim :Tutor does.</description>

      <description>Sidestepping the Roadblock&amp;hellip; While attempting to work through Git BASH yesterday to get this site set up, I got Trapped in Vimâ„¢, which is apparently a very normal experience for beginners:&#xA;After trying what felt like everything that made sense and caving in to my impatience in the moment, I closed the window and learned how to change the default editor in Git Bash and set it to nano:&#xA;git config --global core.</description>
