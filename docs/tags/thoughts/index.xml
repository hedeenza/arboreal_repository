      <description>Challenge Count Even though they&amp;rsquo;ve just been the easy challenges so far, I feel like I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning a lot from the picoCTF challenges I&amp;rsquo;ve completed. In the practice section, they have many challenges graded easy, medium, and hard available to complete. At posting one challenge write up each day, getting through the easy challenges will take me to the beginning of November, the medium challenges will take me through mid-May, and the hard challenges will take me to almost the end of July.</description>

      <description>Introduction Capture the Flag is a means of teaching cybersecurity principles through practical games. Players either try to find flags (often text strings) either held by the event host or other teams using various tools and techniques in order to win. (source Wikipedia)&#xA;The game originated at DEF CON, but after learning that there are a few online platforms to play and learn, I thought it would be fun to try it out.</description>

      <description>Recent Realizations At the time of writing I&amp;rsquo;m only a little more than 4 months into my all-consuming focus on coding, but I&amp;rsquo;m learning a lot quickly. I started my learning acceleration with a one-day, six-hour workshop with the University of Oregon data services department covering basic R in late March. The skills I learned in that workshop served as the foundation for the more powerful data processing that further amplified my primary career.</description>
