      <description>Good Problems? At the current point in the journey, I have hit a bit of a road block. Some of the skills to advance in pwn.college and picoCTF require knowledge of C. While I can read very basic C most of the way due to my experience with other languages, I cannot write it without reference. In order to progress further on both fronts I&amp;rsquo;ll need to spend some time focusing on learning C until such a time I don&amp;rsquo;t have to look every single thing up.</description>

      <description>Introduction An important part of building a continually successful rowing team - or any team with turnover for that matter - is strategic recruitment. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have high quality people coming in as your previous high quality people leave, you&amp;rsquo;re going to be in a tough spot. Many Division 1 teams in the United States recruit from all across the country and internationally to find the talent that will help their team continue their storied legacy of excellence.</description>

      <description>Sidestepping the Roadblock&amp;hellip; While attempting to work through Git BASH yesterday to get this site set up, I got Trapped in Vimâ„¢, which is apparently a very normal experience for beginners:&#xA;After trying what felt like everything that made sense and caving in to my impatience in the moment, I closed the window and learned how to change the default editor in Git Bash and set it to nano:&#xA;git config --global core.</description>

      <description>Recent Realizations At the time of writing I&amp;rsquo;m only a little more than 4 months into my all-consuming focus on coding, but I&amp;rsquo;m learning a lot quickly. I started my learning acceleration with a one-day, six-hour workshop with the University of Oregon data services department covering basic R in late March. The skills I learned in that workshop served as the foundation for the more powerful data processing that further amplified my primary career.</description>
