I need to add the -name option &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; find -name &#39;uber-secret.txt&#39; Got the file path to the file cat &amp;lt;file/path/uber-secret.</description>

      <description>Linux Luminarium As agreed, I would not be doing any write-ups for pwn.college because that&amp;rsquo;s against the ground rules for their generously offered free educational material. That being said, I do want to keep record of the core skills I&amp;rsquo;ve gained through each section of their course in such a way that the notes won&amp;rsquo;t take away from the challenges - because it&amp;rsquo;s in the struggling that learning really happens.</description>

      <description>Challenge Author: Jeffery John&#xA;Difficulty: Easy&#xA;Description Someone&amp;rsquo;s commits seem to be preventing the program from working. Who is it?&#xA;Process / Notes wget and unzip the files cat the message.py Looks like a half-done print statement git log to see the log It looks like one author is committing &amp;ldquo;important business work&amp;rdquo; an uncountable amount of times, at the same time git branch -a shows only the master branch is there cat a bunch of things - no clues cat HEAD gave a reference location, trying to cat refs/heads/master Got a git code, seems to point to the ee09 branch git checkout to that branch, seems the same.</description>

      <description>Challenge Author: Jeffery John&#xA;Difficulty: Easy&#xA;Description Want to play a game? As you use more of the shell, you might be interested in how they work! Binary search is a classic algorithm used to quickly find an item in a sorted list. Can you find the flag? You&amp;rsquo;ll have 1000 possibilities and only 10 guesses.&#xA;Cyber security often has a huge amount of data to look through - from logs, vulnerability reports, and forensics.</description>
