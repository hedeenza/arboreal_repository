      <description>Challenge Author:&#xA;Difficulty: Easy&#xA;Description What was I last working on? I remember writing a note to help me remember&amp;hellip;&#xA;Process / Notes wget and unzip the challenge folder - a lot of files got unzipped from a .git directory cat message.txt - &amp;ldquo;This is what I was working on, but I&amp;rsquo;d need to look at my commit history to know why&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; Checking the tree inside the .git directory There&amp;rsquo;s a COMMIT_MSG cat COMMIT_MSG revealed the flag!</description>

      <description>Challenge Author: Jeffery John&#xA;Difficulty: Easy&#xA;Description Someone&amp;rsquo;s commits seem to be preventing the program from working. Who is it?&#xA;Process / Notes wget and unzip the files cat the message.py Looks like a half-done print statement git log to see the log It looks like one author is committing &amp;ldquo;important business work&amp;rdquo; an uncountable amount of times, at the same time git branch -a shows only the master branch is there cat a bunch of things - no clues cat HEAD gave a reference location, trying to cat refs/heads/master Got a git code, seems to point to the ee09 branch git checkout to that branch, seems the same.</description>

      <description>Challenge Author: NANA AMA ATOMBO-SACKEY&#xA;Difficulty: Easy&#xA;Description Know of little and big endian?&#xA;Process / Notes netcat into the challenge Need to find the little and big endian representations of a word Looks like there&amp;rsquo;s a source file as well - wget that It looks like the program will produce a 5 character word and we&amp;rsquo;ll have to guess the little endian, and the big endian representations of that word in order to receive the flag I know I&amp;rsquo;ve read about endianness before but I can&amp;rsquo;t remember what it is.</description>

      <description>Challenge Author: Jeffery John&#xA;Difficulty: Easy&#xA;Description Want to play a game? As you use more of the shell, you might be interested in how they work! Binary search is a classic algorithm used to quickly find an item in a sorted list. Can you find the flag? You&amp;rsquo;ll have 1000 possibilities and only 10 guesses.&#xA;Cyber security often has a huge amount of data to look through - from logs, vulnerability reports, and forensics.</description>

      <description>Challenge Author: Jeffery John&#xA;Difficulty: Easy&#xA;Description My team has been working very hard on new features for our flag printing program! I wonder how they&amp;rsquo;ll work together?&#xA;Process / Notes wget the zip Another git-based challenge There&amp;rsquo;s a python file (.py) cat on the commitedit message says to add part 3 to the program in refs/heads/feature here seem to be 3 parts git log It looks like we&amp;rsquo;re on the version with just the flag printer.</description>

      <description>Challenge Author:&#xA;Difficulty: Easy&#xA;Description I accidentally wrote the flag down. Good thing I deleted it!&#xA;Process / Notes A lot of files in a .git folder got unzipped cat on a message reads &amp;ldquo;TOP SECRET&amp;rdquo; Recursively grepping grep -r &#39;pico&#39; .git/* - a few things pop up, looks like it&amp;rsquo;ll be in the log file with the initial commit Using tree to help navigate around cat into the files doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to help.</description>

      <description>Challenge Author:&#xA;Difficulty: Easy&#xA;Description Using a secure shell (ssh) is going to be pretty important.
