      <description>Good Problems? At the current point in the journey, I have hit a bit of a road block. Some of the skills to advance in pwn.college and picoCTF require knowledge of C. While I can read very basic C most of the way due to my experience with other languages, I cannot write it without reference. In order to progress further on both fronts I&amp;rsquo;ll need to spend some time focusing on learning C until such a time I don&amp;rsquo;t have to look every single thing up.</description>

      <description>Linux Luminarium As agreed, I would not be doing any write-ups for pwn.college because that&amp;rsquo;s against the ground rules for their generously offered free educational material. That being said, I do want to keep record of the core skills I&amp;rsquo;ve gained through each section of their course in such a way that the notes won&amp;rsquo;t take away from the challenges - because it&amp;rsquo;s in the struggling that learning really happens.</description>

      <description>materials by Bosscoder Academy, found on LinkedIn&#xA;Format The materials are sorted into 24 &amp;ldquo;days&amp;rdquo; of learning, each with a central theme.
