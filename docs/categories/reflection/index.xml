      <description>A Reminder While it feels like there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of time pressure to learn everything as fast as humanly possible, I need to remember that this is going to be a marathon. Basics can be learned quickly, but the knowledge base for this material is vast. It&amp;rsquo;s going to take a long time. Burning out is going to be the biggest obstacle to getting where I want to be - and that&amp;rsquo;s what I can&amp;rsquo;t afford.</description>

      <description>Reflecting on Challenges After doing so many challenges from pwn.college and picoCTF, I&amp;rsquo;ve had some thoughts about the enjoyment of puzzles. This is certainly a great oversimplifications, but there are the types of people that just like having the solution and don&amp;rsquo;t care much for the puzzle. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s out of a lack of tolerance for frustration or lack of patience or just preference for the rush of coming upon the solution, there are some people who just want to complete the task.</description>

      <description>Faster Than Expected I&amp;rsquo;ve been going a little faster than expected - probably because I&amp;rsquo;ve been more time than originally planned - through pwn.college. Linux Luminarium got finished on 2024-09-19, 7 days sooner than the 10 challenges/day rate I had on my original table, and it seems like Optional Refreshers will also be finished ahead of even the fastest timeline. It&amp;rsquo;s been too much fun and I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning too much to want to put it down.</description>

      <description>Recent Realizations At the time of writing I&amp;rsquo;m only a little more than 4 months into my all-consuming focus on coding, but I&amp;rsquo;m learning a lot quickly. I started my learning acceleration with a one-day, six-hour workshop with the University of Oregon data services department covering basic R in late March. The skills I learned in that workshop served as the foundation for the more powerful data processing that further amplified my primary career.</description>
