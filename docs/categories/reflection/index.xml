      <description>Faster Than Expected I&amp;rsquo;ve been going a little faster than expected - probably because I&amp;rsquo;ve been more time than originally planned - through pwn.college. Linux Luminarium got finished on 2024-09-19, 7 days sooner than the 10 challenges/day rate I had on my original table, and it seems like Optional Refreshers will also be finished ahead of even the fastest timeline. It&amp;rsquo;s been too much fun and I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning too much to want to put it down.</description>

I started my learning acceleration with a one-day, six-hour workshop with the University of Oregon data services department covering basic R in late March. The skills I learned in that workshop served as the foundation for the more powerful data processing that further amplified my primary career.</description>
