      <description>Challenge Author: ABRXS, PR10R1TYQ&#xA;Difficulty: Easy&#xA;Description Are overflows just a stack concern?&#xA;Process / Notes wget the files I don&amp;rsquo;t know any C, so this is going to be challenging I checked the binary, but didn&amp;rsquo;t find anything that seemed useful. I even tried a hex dump and nothing seemed useful. Played around with the challenge instance, initialized with the net cat command nc Allowed us to see the status of the heap: by pressing 1 Allowed us to write to the heap: by pressing 2 Allowed us to see the &amp;lsquo;safe variable&amp;rsquo; which they gave to use as safe_var = bico: by pressing 3 Allowed us to attempt to retrieve the flag: by pressing 4 Exits: by pressing 5 After poking around a little, I opened up the source code I could see that there was a section at the top that defined the sizes for the flag, input data, and safe variable.</description>

      <description>Challenge Author: Jeffery John&#xA;Difficulty: Easy&#xA;Description Want to play a game? As you use more of the shell, you might be interested in how they work! Binary search is a classic algorithm used to quickly find an item in a sorted list. Can you find the flag? You&amp;rsquo;ll have 1000 possibilities and only 10 guesses.&#xA;Cyber security often has a huge amount of data to look through - from logs, vulnerability reports, and forensics.</description>

      <description>Challenge Author:&#xA;Difficulty: Easy&#xA;Description I accidentally wrote the flag down. Good thing I deleted it!&#xA;Process / Notes A lot of files in a .git folder got unzipped cat on a message reads &amp;ldquo;TOP SECRET&amp;rdquo; Recursively grepping grep -r &#39;pico&#39; .git/* - a few things pop up, looks like it&amp;rsquo;ll be in the log file with the initial commit Using tree to help navigate around cat into the files doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to help.</description>

      <description>Challenge Author:&#xA;Difficulty: Easy&#xA;Description Can you get the real meaning from this file?&#xA;Process / Notes wget the file file shows its ASCII text The tags on the challenge indicate base64 and Caesar cipher Both cat and strings display the same thing Trying base64 first Looks like we&amp;rsquo;re getting somewhere Using the inbuilt Neo Vim rot13 cipher with g?? That didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to help. What about rot13, then base64? No luck base64 decode nor encode seemed to do anything.</description>

      <description>Challenge Author:&#xA;Difficulty: Easy&#xA;Description The Network Operations Center (NOC) of your local institution picked up a suspicious file. They&amp;rsquo;re getting conflicting information on what type of file it is. They&amp;rsquo;ve brought you in as an external expert to examine the file. Can you extract all the information from this strange file?&#xA;Process / Notes Probably going to need to use the file command. Potentially exiftool as well. The file is pdf format, but file reveals that it&amp;rsquo;s a 50x50 png.</description>

      <description>Challenge Author: Jeffery John&#xA;Description I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten bored of handing out flags as text. Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be cool if they were an image instead?&#xA;Process / Notes Download the zipped file and unzip. file on the file reveals it&amp;rsquo;s a small image. Opening the file shows it&amp;rsquo;s a QR code. Without a phone, the hint about using zbar tools led me to try to figure out what those were. Acquiring zbar tools with sudo apt install zbar-tools Using zbar-tools directly didn&amp;rsquo;t work.</description>

      <title>Capture the Flag - Intro</title>
      <link>https://hedeenza.github.io/arborealrepository/ctf/capture-the-flag-intro/</link>

      <description>Introduction Capture the Flag is a means of teaching cybersecurity principles through practical games. Players either try to find flags (often text strings) either held by the event host or other teams using various tools and techniques in order to win. (source Wikipedia)&#xA;The game originated at DEF CON, but after learning that there are a few online platforms to play and learn, I thought it would be fun to try it out.</description>
