      <description>Faster Than Expected I&amp;rsquo;ve been going a little faster than expected - probably because I&amp;rsquo;ve been more time than originally planned - through pwn.college. Linux Luminarium got finished on 2024-09-19, 7 days sooner than the 10 challenges/day rate I had on my original table, and it seems like Optional Refreshers will also be finished ahead of even the fastest timeline. It&amp;rsquo;s been too much fun and I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning too much to want to put it down.</description>

      <description>pwn.college &amp;ldquo;pwn.college is an education platform for students (and other interested parties) to learn about, and practice, core cybersecurity concepts in a hands-on fashion. In martial arts terms, it is designed to take a “white belt” in cybersecurity through the journey to becoming a “blue belt”, able to approach (simple) cybersecurity competitions (CTFs) and wargames. Our philosophy is “practice makes perfect”.&#xA;The platform is maintained by an awesome team of hackers at Arizona State University.</description>
