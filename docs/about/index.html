      <h1 id="recent-realizations">Recent Realizations</h1>
<p>  At the time of writing I&rsquo;m only a little more than 4 months into coding, but I&rsquo;m learning a lot quickly. I started with a one-day, six-hour workshop with the University of Oregon <a href="https://dataservices.uoregon.edu/">data services department</a> covering basic R in late March. The skills I learned in that workshop served as the foundation for data processing that amplified my primary career. From there I learned to make a basic website to showcase a resume and basic portfolio pieces.</p>
<p>  Many job listings for data positions express a need for SQL knowledge, so I began a <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera.org</a> listing that covered basic <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/linux-and-sql">Linux and SQL.</a> The Linux half of the course got me interested enough in Linux I set up the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Between Linux and PowerShell, I have learned several functions that have aided in many projects since. Needing more SQL I began the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/sql-for-data-science">SQL for Data Science</a> course from UC Davis on Coursera.</p>
<p>  While R and the Command Line tools covered much of the functionality I needed, Python seemed to be the proper tool for some emergent projects. I began my learning with the Software Carpentry <a href="https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/">Python Course</a></p>
<p>  There is still much I need to learn across each language I&rsquo;ve learned and several I haven&rsquo;t. While I&rsquo;ve collected several useful resources, because they are neither distilled nor centralized much is getting lost. That realization sparked the memory of a line from Critical Role - Exandria Unlimited: Calamity, where Marisha Ray as Patia Por&rsquo;co says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;You can hold all the knowledge in the world. But if it dies with you, it doesn&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>  That caused me a weird sense of dread. I&rsquo;m not sure whether starting a website with <code>{blogdown}</code> is the most logical response to that feeling, but it does address some of my main worries:</p>
<ul>
<li>The things I learn can be useful to someone other than me, even after I die.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m still so new to coding, some record of my growth as its happening may be particularly useful, rather than going back and reflecting on it after I&rsquo;ve gained some semblance of skill.</li>
<li>Chance (likely) won&rsquo;t destroy the library.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="title-meaning">Title Meaning</h1>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Arboreal</strong> <em>(adj) - &ldquo;of or relating to or formed by trees&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>  This site will grow over time. I&rsquo;m not perfect and I am going to make mistakes and do things sub-optimally, but that&rsquo;s part of the point. Those imperfections will be useful to me one day, and they may be useful to someone else some day too.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Repository</strong> <em>(n) - &ldquo;a facility where things can be deposited for storage or safekeeping.&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>  The material on this site will theoretically be safe. A computer bricking itself, a fire, or a mistyped command won&rsquo;t destroy the records for all time.</p>
<h1 id="goals-of-this-site">Goals of this Site</h1>
<p>  As I learn cool things, I&rsquo;ll write about it here.</p>
<p>  Any projects of portfolio pieces will go here. It&rsquo;s much easier to update a blogdown site than a simple website in RMarkdown.</p>
<p>  Skills that have been useful to my journey will go here, rather than getting lost in the endless list of bookmarks and videos on my &ldquo;Watch Later&rdquo; playlist.</p>
<p>  Writing about something is an excellent way to learn about something, discussed <a href="https://youtu.be/lML0ndFlBuc?si=S61iDQhxRSrsA29n">here.</a> Hopefully writing about what I learn will aid in its understanding.</p>
