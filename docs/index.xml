      <description>Introduction Capture the Flag is a means of teaching cybersecurity principles through practical games. Players either try to find flags (often text strings) either held by the event host or other teams using various tools and techniques in order to win. (source Wikipedia)&#xA;The game originated at DEF CON, but after learning that there are a few online platforms to play and learn, I thought it would be fun to try it out.</description>

      <guid>https://hedeenza.github.io/arborealrepository/2024/08/29/installing-pytorch/</guid>
      <description>Introduction I looked into working with PyTorch because it appears I&amp;rsquo;ll be running some machine-learning type projects in the near future, and PyTorch is a way to run that within Python - another area I&amp;rsquo;m actively expanding my skills. My hardware isn&amp;rsquo;t the strongest, so it was a question about whether I&amp;rsquo;d even meet the system requirements going in.&#xA;What is PyTorch? From their github page:&#xA;&amp;quot;PyTorch is a Python package that provides two high-level features: - Tensor computation (like NumPy) with strong GPU acceleration - Deep neural networks built on a tape-based autograd system You can reuse your favorite Python packages such as NumPy, SciPy, and Cython to extend PyTorch when needed.</description>

      <description>Version Troubles I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with Neo Vim a lot more than I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing about it. It&amp;rsquo;s been 19 days since I first got trapped and despite that short time, I feel quite comfortable using the tool. There is certainly a ton of learning still to go before I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to zoom around and manipulate code at the speed of thought, but progress is progress.&#xA;The version that the Windows Subsystem for Linux installs is v0.</description>

      <description>Neo Vim Lesson Series Looking up all the Vim content on YouTube told the algorithm to send me some more. I stumbled upon a series by the creator ThePrimeagen that details more commands in Vim and Neo Vim. I&amp;rsquo;ll do my best to only add here what hasn&amp;rsquo;t been covered already. But if you&amp;rsquo;re interested, here&amp;rsquo;s the link to the full playlist.&#xA;Introduction (#1) This covers a lot of the basics that the Vim :Tutor does.</description>

      <description>Introduction An important part of building a continually successful rowing team - or any team with turnover for that matter - is strategic recruitment. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have high quality people coming in as your previous high quality people leave, you&amp;rsquo;re going to be in a tough spot. Many Division 1 teams in the United States recruit from all across the country and internationally to find the talent that will help their team continue their storied legacy of excellence.</description>
