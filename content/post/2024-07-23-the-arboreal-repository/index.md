# Title Meaning 

Repository - a safe place to store and retrieve information 

arboreal - like a tree, I'm not perfect and am going to make mistakes and not do things perfectly. better to log while I'm going through
it and not in hind-site. Maybe useful to someone else someday.


# Goals?

Learn some cool stuff? going here

projects

the things that are useful on my journey, not buried in a mess of bookmarks

writing about something is a good way to learn it
